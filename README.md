# Canonical Exercise
Here is the code for the Frontend Take Home test. 
I hope you'll find it to your taste :)

## A few notes
- The third article's data seems to be compromised. It doesn't have a working URL, nor the right image, nor a designated topic in the API data. I still fetched the data from the API as requested. This would need some fixing on the API side, or maybe this article should be removed if it was unpublished.

- I was unable to find some of the colors in the Ubuntu color palette, so I went for the closest ones.

- I made some design choices, that I afterwards realized were not the same you had already on your blog (for example: not underlining the text when hovering the link, or placing the link on the whole card instead of the image and the title only). These could easily be changed if needed.

### Happy reviewing!
